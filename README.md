## Solo Audits

The right solo auditor **cuts costs** while helping you better secure your protocol.

- **Cost-efficient** â€“ pay for expertise, not corporate overhead.  
- **Flexible** â€“ scope and timeline match your roadmap.  
- **Transparent** â€“ one auditor, clear accountability, publicly verifiable credibility.  

An early solo review shows you exactly where to focus next for properly securing your project, so you **never overspend money** on audits.
